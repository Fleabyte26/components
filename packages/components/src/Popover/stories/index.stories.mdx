# Popover

Popovers are containers for things like contextual information, menus, and related actions.

## Terminology

Popovers are assembled of two pieces: an overlay and a surface. Unlike [Dialogs](/components/dialogs/), the `Popover` overlay is transparent, but it still blocks the application behind it until it is closed, with the exception of [grouped Popovers](#grouped-popovers). The `Popover`'s surface renders the content above the overlay and the rest of the application.

<Editor code={storyPopoverWithLayout} />

## Placement

Placement can be adjusted with the `placement` prop. Valid positions are `top`, `left`, `right` and `bottom`, each can be augmented with -`start` or `-end` which places the edge of the popover at the start or end of the target.

<Editor code={storyPlacement} />

## Arrow

Show the arrow pointing toward trigger element by setting this prop to true, or pass an object .

<Editor code={storyArrow} />

## Disclosing the Trigger on Hover

<Editor code={storyHover} />

## PopoverContent

`PopoverContent` is a simple container component that can be used to apply a consistent style to content placed within a Popover surface.

## "Render Prop" style

Sometimes you may need to control how `Tooltip` applies handlers to the component within it. If so you can use the render prop form of the component:

<Editor code={storyRenderProps} />

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Popover} exclude={excludedProps} />

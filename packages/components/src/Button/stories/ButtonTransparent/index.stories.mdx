# ButtonTransparent

Use a transparent button as a tertiary action on a screen, they are often used as a Cancel button on a form. Typically it performs the opposite action of a default button

<Editor code={storyBasic} />

## Color

`Key` is the primary brand color, which is the default setting.
`Critical` Buttons are to be used in situations where you need to convey some very important, potentially irreversible consequence of pressing this button.

<Editor code={storyCritical} />

`Neutral` buttons are meant to fade into the background. These are usually used for secondary, nonessential, actions.

<Editor code={storyNeutral} />

`Positive` variants should be used sparingly, but can be integrated into a successful state update.

<Editor code={storyPositive} />

## Size

Use the size property on a `<Button />` to modify the size the button rendered. You can combine it with the `mode` property to get the correct style and size of button you need.

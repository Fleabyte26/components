# Button

Use a default button for the most frequently used action or most important action on a page. Default buttons should only appear once on a page. They are sometimes accompanied by a secondary button.

<Editor code={storyBasic} />

## Color

`Key` is the primary brand color, which is the default setting.
`Critical` Buttons are to be used in situations where you need to convey some very important, potentially irreversible consequence of pressing this button.

<Editor code={storyCritical} />

`Neutral` buttons are meant to fade into the background. These are usually used for secondary, nonessential, actions.

<Editor code={storyNeutral} />

`Positive` variants should be used sparingly, but can be integrated into a successful state update.

<Editor code={storyPositive} />

## Size

Use the size property on a `<Button />` to modify the size the button rendered. You can combine it with the `mode` property to get the correct style and size of button you need.

<Editor code={storyXSmall} />
<Editor code={storySmall} />
<Editor code={storyMedium} />
<Editor code={storyLarge} />

## Full Width

Use the `fullWidth` property on a `<Button />` and it will set its width to 100%.

<Editor code={storyFullWidth} />

## Disabled

Use a disabled button to indicate to the user what action will be possible on a page once a prerequisite action is taken. Disabled buttons do not respond to user interaction.

<Editor code={storyDisabled} />

## Aria Disabled

Use aria disabled to capture the disabled styles but still have interaction events to work. This is ideal for when you want the button to appear as disabled but still trigger rendering of a Tooltip.
**Note:** if you don't want the `onClick` to function run, you'll need to account for that in your code.

<Editor code={storyDisabled} />

## Icons

Buttons can have an icon before or after their content, using the `iconBefore` and `iconAfter` property. Each property accepts the [name of an icon](/#!/Icons)

<Editor code={storyIconBefore} />
<Editor code={storyIconAfter} />

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Button} exclude={excludedProps} />
